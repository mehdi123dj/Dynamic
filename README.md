This code contains a part of the experiment to be  added/discussed in the paper **Clustering of temporal nodes profiles in dynamic networks of contacts.**

To have them displayed on your terminal : 
* Download the repository with the datasets present in ./data.
* Go to the root of the repo and create once and for all a set of pickled objects which represent the different elements necessary to the following calculations (once they are created, they are automatically stored in the data folder and do not need to be recreated). 
* Run classifier.py to obtain the results of different classifiers on the representations provided by different algorithms (ItRich, K-core, Degree). 
* More precisions coming for the description of each parameter in classifier.py
