* Download the repository with the datasets present in ./data.
* Create once and for all a set of pickled objects representinf the different elements necessary to the following calculations (once they are created, they are automatically stored in the data folder and do not need to be recreated). 
* Run classifier.py to obtain the results of different classifiers on the representations provided by different algorithms (ItRich, K-core, Degree). 
* More precisions coming for the description of each parameter in classifier.py
